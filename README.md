# Habit Tracker App

## Introduction
This app is a basic habit tracking app build using Python. You can create habits (daily/weekly), track them and try sustaining a streak for as long as possible. The app uses CLI with a simple, easy to use design.
The program was only tested on Mac.

## Instalation

2. Open then in your IDE
3. Install the requirements bellow and make sure you have python installed
 
 ```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

## Usage
First start typing this into the terminal:

 ```
python main.py
 ```
 The app will ask you if you want to start and then you will get to the main menu where you will have option for creating, completing, deleting and analysing the habits. In the analyse sub menu you will have predefined chioce for analysing the streak or habits you track. When you want to exit the app simply choose "exit" in the main menu. The app comes with an empty database so start by creating habit first ot be able to work further with it.

## Testing

Run the following command to test the program with test database containing 4 weeks of records of 5 daily and 5 weekly habits and tests of the program functionality.
11 tests will be run to test getting habits and streak operation.
